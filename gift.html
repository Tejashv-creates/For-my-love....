          <p>I don't where to start cause everything about you makes go mad so I'll start anyways. Today you are turning 18 and I still see you as my baby always whenever I look at you my heart melts everything just goes silent I can't see anything but you, each hair on my body give me chilla my heart beat grows and your eyes look like it had both the sun's brightness and moon's beauty. Your skin looks like a comforting hug. Eyelashes as a heavenly kiss and a hair that falls with the smile on your face makes me sink more in love.</p>
          <p>I love it when you are lost in the surroundings and i am lost in you reading every detail of that amazingly pretty face makes my heart go crazy and overjoyed, i always feel could've catched more sight of that gentle face. I can't give you my diary by now but here's something I wrote for you on 28 March when I saw you after you told me that you won't come to school and you are going to Goa so here it goes -</p>
          <p>I tried in every conceivable form of manifestation and it came to life across my countless tears and words you arrived and this gives me dancing joy. Through everything my heart finds it's way to you my love there exists nothing i would shy from doing,my devotion for you knows no bound. You are the light to my life, with you beside me, my heart dances with joy. Fluttering into a thousand sensations that I've never felt. I can almost foresee myself gathering those very stars, thier radiant light spilling like silver, and laying them on your feet if the delight you ❤️</p>
          <p>Can't imagine life is so magical with you whenever i think about future with you my heart flows like a stream. Maybe it's you or feelings but whatever it is it worths me more than anything it's precious more than the earth itself. Talking to you feels like what on earth how God made her so perfect. Happiness around feels like a small word and when I am around it packs more than a word and feeling. You are the main character to my life. And realising this I wrote something for you:</p>
          <blockquote>"Tum toh chand ho mere baiger bhi chamko gi<br/>Main woh asmaan hu jo tere baigar bilkul tanha hu"</blockquote>
          <p>You turning 18 is the best thing I am witnessing and I want to see more 90 years with you on every birthday I want to be with you on every birthday of yours and mine. I want to roam the world with you—with you the world feels full and without you if even the world is full of people I'll still feel lonely. Can't wait to live and enjoy every moment with you Asi. Happy Birthday—I love you so so much—forehead kissss 🫶</p>
